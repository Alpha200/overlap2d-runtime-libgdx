##**o2d-libgdx-ashley runtime**

The o2d-libgdx-ashley provides functionality to load, manipulate and render scenes generated by [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/).

##**Important**
Starting from vetsion 0.1.0 overlap2d libgdx runtime is now based on Ashley entity framework. Thus eliminating any traces of
Actors and Stage. 


##Spine
Please make sure you have Spine runtime included in a way, for this to work 
(surely we'll fix this closer to release)

##Note

If you want to take it for a spin, you can't use data files generated by previous editor versions. Instead open, save and export your previous project with new editor. which is not released yet, but you can find sources and run it if you are really persistant from my fork :-P
