##**Overlap2dRuntime**

The Overlap2dRuntime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render scenes generated by [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/).

##**Setup**

The normal way:
For existing project, just add this line to dependencies of your core project in main build.gradle file

    compile "com.underwaterapps.overlap2druntime:overlap2d-runtime-libgdx:[version]"

Or, if creating new prohect, why not use libGDX setup app? Here are the instructions:

##Spine

[Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) animations are now optional. You must download [spine libgdx runtime](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-libgdx) and include it in your project. If you don't have spine runtime SpineActors will not be created and used by overlap2druntime.

##Note

Please note that [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/) is in development and this runtime is for test purposes.
While sources might stay same, architecture will definitely change.
Also you can try to write your own runtime based on this.
